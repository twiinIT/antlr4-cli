# `ANTLR4-CLI`

This project provides a drop-in replacement for `antlr4-tools`.

Instead of querying for updates, requiring internet access for first usage
or slowering the CLI when reaching timeout, this version of the CLI embed 
the jar file matching the project version by downloading it at install time.
